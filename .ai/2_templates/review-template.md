# Code Review Report: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Reviewed**: [DATE]
**Reviewer**: AI Code Review Agent
**Status**: In Progress

## Review Scope Determination

**CRITICAL: Determine scope before proceeding**

Ask user: "What scope should I review?"
- **Option 1**: Feature branch changes only (git diff main...HEAD)
- **Option 2**: Uncommitted changes only (git diff HEAD)
- **Option 3**: Entire project/codebase
- **Option 4**: Specific directory or file path

**DO NOT ASSUME** - wait for user confirmation.

Once scope is determined, document it:
- **Scope**: [NEEDS ANSWER: branch changes / uncommitted / entire project / specific path]
- **Base comparison**: [if branch: main/master, if uncommitted: HEAD, if project: N/A]
- **Files in scope**: [list after determining scope]

---

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Determine review scope (ASK USER - do not assume)
   → Wait for: branch changes / uncommitted / entire project / path
   → Document scope clearly
2. Identify feature context (if feature branch)
   → Load: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md from specs/[branch-name]/
   → If not feature branch: skip to step 3
3. Read constitution.md for standards
4. Collect files to review based on scope
   → Branch: git diff main...HEAD
   → Uncommitted: git diff HEAD
   → Project: all source files
   → Path: specified directory/files
5. Run Automated Checks (tests, linting, build)
   → Adapt commands to project build tool
   → If not configured: document and proceed
6. Run Architecture Review checklist
   → Mark violations as CRITICAL
7. Run Code Quality Assessment checklist
   → Mark issues as MAJOR or MINOR
8. Run Testing Scrutiny checklist
   → Mark gaps as CRITICAL or MAJOR
9. If feature context exists:
   → Run Specification Compliance checklist
   → Run Plan Alignment checklist
   → Run Task Completion checklist
10. Run Constitutional Compliance checklist
    → Mark violations by severity
11. Aggregate findings by severity
12. Determine overall verdict
    → APPROVE: No critical/major issues
    → REQUEST CHANGES: Critical or major issues found
    → COMMENT: Only minor issues or suggestions
13. Generate actionable feedback report
14. Return: Review report with verdict and next steps
```

## Review Context *(loaded during execution)*

### Feature Information (if applicable)
- **Spec**: `specs/[branch-name]/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `specs/[branch-name]/plan.md`
- **Tasks**: `specs/[branch-name]/tasks.md`
- **Constitution**: `constitution.md`

### Scope Information

## Review Checklists

### 0. Automated Checks
*Run automated tools before manual review*

**Run and report** (adapt commands to project build tool):
```bash
# Tests
{test-command}                    # → X passed, Y failed

# Static analysis / linting
{lint-command}                    # → violations count

# Build verification
{build-command}                   # → SUCCESS/FAILURE
```

**Result**: [PASS / FAIL + details]

> Adapt commands based on project stack (e.g., `mvn test`, `./gradlew clean test`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `dotnet test`).
> If automated tools are not configured, document as "Automated checks: NOT CONFIGURED" and proceed with manual review.

### 1. Architecture Review
*Verify architectural patterns and boundaries*

- [ ] **Domain layer purity**: No external dependencies in domain
- [ ] **Dependency direction**: Adapters depend on domain, not vice versa
- [ ] **Port/Adapter boundaries**: Clear separation maintained
- [ ] **Package structure**: Follows plan.md and constitution.md
- [ ] **Layer violations**: No architectural boundary crossings

**Findings**:
- [List architecture violations with file:line references]

---

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
*Evaluate code clarity and standards compliance*

- [ ] **Readability**: Code is clear and self-documenting
- [ ] **Naming conventions**: Evergreen names (no "new", "improved", "v2")
- [ ] **Modern idioms**: Appropriate use of language features
- [ ] **Framework conventions**: Proper use of framework patterns
- [ ] **Time handling**: No direct `.now()` calls, time injection used
- [ ] **Temporal language**: No "recently", "new", "old" in comments
- [ ] **File endings**: All files end with newline (POSIX)

**Findings**:
- [List code quality issues with file:line references]

---

### 3. Testing Scrutiny
*Verify test coverage and quality*

- [ ] **Test-first evidence**: Tests exist for all business logic
- [ ] **Coverage completeness**: Unit, integration, e2e tests present
- [ ] **Test quality**: Arrange-Act-Assert structure, clear names
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Edge cases from spec.md tested (if applicable)
- [ ] **Test independence**: Tests don't depend on each other
- [ ] **Real dependencies**: Integration tests use appropriate test doubles
- [ ] **Mock usage**: Mocks only for ports/external dependencies

**Findings**:
- [List testing gaps with file:line references]

---

### 4. Specification Compliance *(if feature branch)*
*Verify requirements are met*

- [ ] **Requirements coverage**: All acceptance criteria addressed
- [ ] **User stories**: All user stories implemented
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, observability met
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] **API contracts**: Endpoints match plan.md (if applicable)

**Findings**:

---

### 5. Plan Alignment *(if feature branch)*
*Verify implementation follows plan*

- [ ] **Architecture match**: Implementation follows plan.md
- [ ] **Tech stack**: Specified technologies used correctly
- [ ] **Data model**: Entities match data-model.md (if exists)
- [ ] **File structure**: Code organized per plan.md
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Only approved dependencies used

**Findings**:
- [List plan deviations with plan reference]

---

### 6. Constitutional Compliance
*Verify adherence to project constitution*
